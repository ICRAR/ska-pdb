Object densities are defined on a Hierarchical Triangular Mesh (http://taltos.pha.jhu.edu/htm) of level 6 comprised of almost-equal-area cells of approximately 1 square degree in size. The model is a synthesis of count predictions from two distinct sources: (i) the Bescancon Galaxy model (http://bison.obs-besancon.fr/modele), in conjunction with the extinction law of R. Drimmel, for stars; and (ii) the GSC-II catalogue (http://www-gsss.stsci.edu/gsc/gsc2/GSC2home.htm) for stars and galaxies. The combined result can be summarised as follows: (a) Bright stars: 4 <= G <= 12.5: GSC-II (Tycho-2 catalogue included); 4 <= GS <= 12.5: GSC-II (Tycho-2 catalogue included); 4 <= G_RVS <= 12.5: GSC-II (Tycho-2 catalogue included); (b) Faint stars: 12.5 <= G <= 21: Bescancon; 12.5 <= GS <= 21: Bescancon; 12.5 <= G_RVS <= 18: Bescancon; (c) Stars in special regions (LMC/SMC): counts for full range of magnitudes, for circle with radius 10 deg (LMC) and 7 deg (SMC), taken from the GSC-II catalogue; (d) galaxies: G <= 21: GSC-II; GS <= 21: GSC-II; G_RVS <= 18: GSC-II. The following Bintables are defined: (1) STAR-G-MAGGRID: magnitude grid for column COUNTS in following extension STAR-G-COUNTS; (2) STAR-G-COUNTS: table with star magnitude counts in column COUNTS per HTM cell in the G band; each row corresponds to one cell. Table columns are: HTMID: unique HTM cell designator; AREA: area of cell [square deg]; ALPHA: right ascension of cell centre [h]; DELTA: declination of cell centre [deg]; LGAL: Galactic longitude of cell centre [deg]; BGAL: Galactic latitude of cell centre [deg]; COUNTS: non-cumulative number of objects per square degree in cell in 0.5 magnitude-bin interval, i.e., COUNTS[i] is the number of stars per square degree in the magnitude interval [STAR-G-MAGGRID[i], STAR-G-MAGGRID[i]+0.5]; (3) GAL-G-MAGGRID: same as STAR-G-MAGGRID, but for galaxies; (4) GAL-G-COUNTS: same as STAR-G-COUNTS, but for galaxies; (5) STAR-GS-MAGGRID: same as STAR-G-MAGGRID, but in GS band; (6) STAR-GS-COUNTS: same as STAR-G-COUNTS, but in GS band; (7) GAL-GS-MAGGRID: same as STAR-GS-MAGGRID, but for galaxies; (8) GAL-GS-COUNTS: same as STAR-GS-COUNTS, but for galaxies; (9) STAR-C1M861-MAGGRID: same as STAR-G-MAGGRID, but in G_RVS band; (10) STAR-C1M861-COUNTS: same as STAR-G-COUNTS, but in G_RVS band; (11) GAL-C1M861-MAGGRID: same as STAR-C1M861-MAGGRID, but for galaxies; and (12) GAL-C1M861-COUNTS: same as STAR-C1M861-COUNTS, but for galaxies","The data used to produce the standard Gaia Galaxy model have been provided by the teams of the Observatoire de Besancon (A.

Note that cosmic rays and solar protons are distinct particles, collectively refered to as prompt-particle events (PPEs). A PPE rate of 1145 particles cm^-2 s^-1 is assumed to correspond to the operational limit below which Gaia functions nominally and above which the spacecraft will be in transient mode. An isotropic prompt-particle event flux N, in units of events cm^-2 s^-1, generates 2 N A / 4 events s^-1 CCD^-1, where A denotes the active-pixel area of the CCD in units of cm^2 (including any reduction as a result of TDI-gating), the factor 2 results from considering 'inflow' through both the illuminated and the non-illuminated faces of the CCD, and the factor 4 results from the 'flat geometry' of the CCD (see J.H.J. de Bruijne, A.
